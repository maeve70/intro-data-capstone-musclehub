# intro-data-capstone-musclehub
1st project done for Codecademy course in data analytics
A/B testing for a gym. 
From the course:
"Currently, when a visitor to MuscleHub is considering buying a membership, he or she follows the following steps:

- Take a fitness test with a personal trainer
- Fill out an application for the gym
- Send in their payment for their first month's membership

Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.

Visitors will randomly be assigned to one of two groups:

- Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer
- Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application

Janet's hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub.

You will help her analyze the data and create a presentation.

*Update 1.31.22: I realize that the slides are kind of "busy", but this project had specific things I had to include on the slides. If I did this over I would include an appendix with all the data specifics and go with a "less is more" approach to each slide's layout.*
