1st project done for Codecademy course in data analytics
A/B testing for a gym. 
From the course:
"Currently, when a visitor to MuscleHub is considering buying a membership, he or she follows the following steps:

1. Take a fitness test with a personal trainer
2.Fill out an application for the gym
3. end in their payment for their first month's membership

Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.

Visitors will randomly be assigned to one of two groups:

-Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer
-Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application
-Janet's hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub.

You will help her analyze the data and create a presentation.
